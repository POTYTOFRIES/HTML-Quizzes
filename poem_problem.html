    <h3>Trees</h3>

    <p>
      I think that I shall never see <br>
      A poem lovely as a tree.
    </p>

    <p>A tree whose hungry mouth is prest <br>
       Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;</p>

    <p>A tree that looks at God all day, <br>
      And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
    </p>

    <p>A tree that may in Summer wear <br>
      A nest of robins in her hair;</p>

    <p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain; <br>
      Who intimately lives with rain.</p>

    <p>Poems are made by fools like me, <br>
      But only God can make a tree.</p>
